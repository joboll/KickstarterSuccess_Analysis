### What is this repository for? ###

1. This is a portefolio repo to allow external peek into some of my data analytic and reporting skills with Python.
2. This repo includes two Jupyter Lab Notebooks.
    - Kickstarter_cleanup_phase1.ipynb.ipynb: Show you how I went about bulk import of multiple CSV files which were the results of a web scraping run.
    - Kickstarter_Analysis.ipynb: Refines the data cleaning up and pushes to answer questions critical to decision making. When is it better to launch and Kickstarter campaign? How long should it last? How much can we realistically expect to make? Few months later, we raised 2 millon dollars with our campaign.

### Why are the datasets missing? ###

* Data sets are simply to large. 1Gb exeeds Github's limit.
* You can still see the Notebook cells as processed by me.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Install Anaconda or miniConda to create virtual environment and manage package easily
* Create a venv using the requirements.txt as a reference to install required dependencies ($ conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt)
* In terminal, clone the repo.
* In terminal, from the directory, open a Jupyter Lab session by typing $ jupyter lab
